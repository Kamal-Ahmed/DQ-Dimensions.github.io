## Data Quality Dimensions, Definitions and Data Concepts

The Data Quality working group of the Data Management Association in the Netherlands (DAMA NL) carried out an extensive research into definitions of dimensions of data quality. It has collected definitions from various sources and compared these with each other. The working group also evaluated the definitions against criteria derived from a standard for concepts and definitions: ISO 704. New in the data ecosystem is that all dimensions are linked to a 'data concept' such as a data file, an attribute, a record and a data value. This simplifies distinguishing between, for example, the completeness of records and the completeness of data values. These data concepts are also provided with standardized definitions. This research has led to a list of 60 dimensions of data quality and 20 data concepts with standardized definitions. From this list, 12 common dimensions have been selected.

Hovering the mouse over a coloured cell in the grid shown on the right, will reveal the Data Quality Dimension, its Definition and Data Concept.

Light coloured cells represent the general combination of Data Quality Dimensions and Data Concepts. The 12 dark coloured cells represent the combination of Data Quality Dimensions and Data Concepts most commonly used.
